# Adding Your Project to the Frax Ecosystem

Follow these steps to add your project to the ecosystem data JSON file and have it featured on [Frax.com's Ecosystem Page](https://www.frax.com/ecosystem):

## 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [FraxFinance/docs](https://github.com/FraxFinance/docs) repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## 2: Add Your Project Data

1. Locate the `ecosystem-data.json` file in the [docs/public](https://github.com/FraxFinance/docs/blob/master/public/ecosystem-data.json) folder of your forked repository.
2. Create a new branch with the name of your own project as the branch name (ex. `frax-finance`).
3. Edit the file and add an object representing your project to the `items` array. Ensure the following fields are included in your object:
   - `key`: A unique identifier for your project, such as the name of the project. Make sure the chosen key has no spaces or capitals.
   - `name`: The name of your project.
   - `url`: The URL of your project's website.
   - `description`: A brief description of your project (less than 180 characters).
   - `tags`: An array of tags describing your project's category (can choose from `["DeFi", "DEX", "DEX Aggregator", "Lending", "DAO", "NFT", "Infra", "Bridge", "Oracle", "OnRamp", "AI"]`).
   - `imageUrl`: The URL of your project's logo image (must be square and good resolution). **Please note that your project's logo will be displayed in a circular format, similar to the existing projects featured on the [ecosystem page](https://www.frax.com/ecosystem)**
   - `twitterXUrl` (optional): The URL of your project's Twitter/X account.
   - `discordUrl` (optional): The URL of your project's Discord server.
   - `telegramUrl` (optional): The URL of your project's Telegram group.

## 3: Add Logo Image (if needed)

1. If you don't have a URL for your logo image, add a PNG file with square dimensions to the public/images/ecosystem folder of your forked repository. **Please note that your project's logo will be displayed in a circular format, similar to the existing projects featured on the [ecosystem page](https://www.frax.com/ecosystem)**
2. Update the `imageUrl` field in your project's object to https://docs.frax.com/images/ecosystem/your_image_name.png

## 4: Submit a Pull Request

1. Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
2. Create a new pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main FraxFinance/docs repository.
3. Once your PR is approved and merged, your project will be included in the Frax ecosystem!
4. It will appear on frax.com/ecosystem for everyone to see.
