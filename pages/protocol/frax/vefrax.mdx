# veFRAX
veFRAX is the staked version of FRAX (prev. FXS) the **Commodity Asset** of the entire Frax universe. veFRAX has various utility and votes in all governance decisions throughout the Frax ecosystem of protocols. Users stake their FRAX tokens for a self-selected period of between 1 week to 208 weeks (4 years). A user’s veFRAX balance is non-transferrable (it is not a separate token) and is linearly correlated with the amount of FRAX they staked multiplied by their lock time. For every 1 FRAX token staked for 4 years, a user’s veFRAX balance goes up by 4. A user’s veFRAX balance decays slowly as a user’s unlock time approaches.
